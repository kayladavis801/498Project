# 498Project
Welcome to cybersector!
This project includes many files called ViewController.swift, Main.storyboard, 
GameViewController.swift, and DragViewController.swift.

ViewController.swift
This file will include all of the buttons that are used to transition from own 
screen to the other as well as being the home navigation for the app as a whole.

Main.storyboard
This file is how you design what board will look like. I personally chose a 
theme of purple but you can make it whatever you would like.

GameViewController.swif
This file is home to the question game. Inside has all the code the 50 questions,
an if statement for the right or wrong statements, and shuffling the quesions for the user.

DragViewController.swift
this file is hone to the Drag and drop game. It will have all of the code to make objects 
move with the users cursor once tapped. It will also have code to turn both objects green if 
they collide appropiatly. 

To install this specific game, use the http link under code on the right corner, go to your 
terminal, and type "git clone <http link>" into the correct file you want it stored in.
